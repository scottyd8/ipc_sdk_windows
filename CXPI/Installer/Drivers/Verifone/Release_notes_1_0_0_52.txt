3. Driver uses internal buffer for data read storage. If the buffer read is almost 80% full, 
   it will not place for further reads to the USB device as buffer is becoming full and wait for
   application to read the data and empty this buffer.  This functionality is bypassed to
   over come the "USB device write freezes Vx820 terminal" problem reported.
